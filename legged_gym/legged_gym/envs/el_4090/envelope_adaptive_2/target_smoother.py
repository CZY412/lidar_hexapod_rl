"""Rate-limited smoothing of the oracle target (production).

Wraps the stateless grid oracle with the legacy rule computer's hysteresis
(shrink fast, grow slow, cooldown before growth) in normalised extent space,
so the supervised envelope target cannot jump between control steps when the
active-set binding sample switches.  A per-env safety check snaps any env
whose rate-limited candidate would itself be unsafe straight back to the raw
(safety-verified) oracle.

Rates are PHYSICAL (metres per second of envelope extent) and are converted
with the control ``dt`` at construction into per-call steps normalised by
each parameter's extent span.  The 10 Hz validation constants (shrink
0.12 extent/call, grow 0.03 extent/call, cooldown 5 calls) correspond to
~0.4 m/s, ~0.1 m/s and 0.5 s.  At the env's 50 Hz the approach demand is
~0.02 m/call, so the env defaults (shrink 2.0 m/s = 0.04 m/call) track
normal approach without lag while still rate-limiting the rare
binding-sample switching jumps (up to ~0.11 m).
