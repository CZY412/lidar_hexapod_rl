"""Build the fixed 187-channel range image for envelope_adaptive_2.

The 187 channels are pre-selected from the full Airy pattern and correspond
one-to-one to the cells of a body-frame ground region.  This module therefore
does not perform old-style multi-ray bucket aggregation or ``r_min``/``max_range``
filtering.  Instead:

* each channel keeps its raw slant distance;
* no-hit / out-of-region distances are replaced by ``max_range`` (the
  normalization divisor);
* the observation is normalized by ``max_range``.

``max_range`` is the maximum slant distance among the selected 187 channels,
rounded up to 0.1 m.
